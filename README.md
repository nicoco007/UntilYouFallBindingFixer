# Until You Fall Binding Fixer
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/nicoco007/UntilYouFallBindingFixer/Build?style=flat-square)

Small mod that allows movement, dash, and turn bindings to be remapped to either controller. Works with [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) v0.3.0 and v0.4.3. Note that you need to change the bindings in your SteamVR controller settings for this to have any effect.
